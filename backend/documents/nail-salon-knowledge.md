# Request

-   Hello! I’m interested in booking an appointment for a nail service. I’d like a full set of acrylic nails with a coffin shape, medium length, and a design that incorporates a French tip style with an ombre pink base. I’d also love to add some small rhinestones on a few nails if possible. I’m not sure about the exact shade, so it would be great if I could see some options when I come in. Could you let me know about availability this weekend? I’m flexible with timing, though ideally, something around late morning or early afternoon would be perfect.
-   Also, I’d love to know the approximate price range for this kind of design. I’ve heard amazing things about the nail art quality here, so I’m excited to try it out! If there's an option to add a pedicure or some kind of foot treatment after the nail service, I’d be interested in that too—maybe a basic pedicure with a color that matches the manicure. Looking forward to hearing back from you!

## Breakdown

-   Full Set of Acrylic Nails: Typically takes about 45-60 minutes.
-   Coffin Shape: Shaping the nails can add about 15-20 minutes.
-   French Tip Style with Ombre Pink Base: This design can take an additional 30-45 minutes.
-   Adding Rhinestones: Adding small rhinestones can take about 10-15 minutes.
-   Pedicure: A basic pedicure usually takes about 10-15 minutes.
-   Time: 2 hours
